# 🚗 Road Sign Classifier using TensorFlow (GTSRB Dataset)

This project uses **deep learning and computer vision** to classify traffic signs, a core component of perception systems in self-driving cars. We train a neural network using the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset to recognize 43 types of traffic signs.
